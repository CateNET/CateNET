## 🚀 CateNET Formula

> We build digital systems that look incredible, run reliably, and rank where it matters.

- `Development` – Web • Mobile • Software • AI Solutions
- `Infrastructure` – Remote Ops • On-Site Support • Cloud Migration
- `Branding` – Design Services • Logo Design • Business Cards • Brand Identity
- `SEO` – On-Page • Backlink Building • Local SEO
- `Confidentiality` – 99% of delivery is private-by-default; sanitized artifacts only hit GitHub when they clear NDA review.

## 📊 Delivery Principles

- Ship with measurable goals, not vanity metrics
- Protect client data and confidentiality by default
- Favor automation and reproducibility for every environment
- Pair design + engineering + SEO so launches are cohesive
- Document runbooks, retros, and lessons so teams keep improving

---

## 🛠️ Automation Philosophy

- **GitOps Everything**: environments tracked in Git, progressive delivery baked-in
- **Shift-Left Security**: SAST/DAST, SBOMs, policy-as-code guardrails
- **Observability First**: SLO-driven alerts, cured runbooks, chaos drills
- **Test Everywhere**: contract tests, snapshots, infra validation, failover rehearsals

## 🧑‍💻 GitHub Ops Space

```bash
# Daily ritual inside the org
gh run watch --repo CateNET-Solutions/platform-pipeline
gh secret list --org CateNET-Solutions
gh workflow run lint.yml --repo CateNET-Solutions/template-next --ref main
```

- `Codespaces` templates for front-end, back-end, data, and design QA squads
- `Action packs` for lint/test/build/deploy with reusable job matrices + concurrency tuning
- `Issue forms` with auto-triage labels → piped into Projects v2 boards for each practice
- `Dependabot` + `Renovate` tandem: semver-aware PR groups, preview env per dependency batch

---

## 🧪 Labs & Open Source

> Client work lives behind encryption + NDAs. The public feed below is deliberately sparse and sanitized—call it the “view from the lab window.”

- `🔒 Private Modules` → Internal registries for Terraform, Helm, npm, NuGet (mirrored via GitHub Packages)
- `🧬 Reusable Actions` → Composite workflows for lint/test/deploy, released only when vendor-agnostic
- `🧢 Snippet Gists` → Tiny utilities, CLIs, or design token shims when we can safely share

```bash
# GitHub geek mode enabled
gh repo list CateNET-Solutions --private --limit 5 --json name,updatedAt,visibility
gh workflow list --repo CateNET-Solutions/.github
gh codespace list --org CateNET-Solutions
```

Most client code stays private. Public repos are primarily templates, starter kits, and tooling experiments we can safely share. Check the [org repositories](https://github.com/CateNET-Solutions?tab=repositories) for anything newly published.
